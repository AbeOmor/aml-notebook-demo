1.	**Clone project** from Git using the AzureML Terminal
2.	**Review the repo’s** content in the README via AzureML with the new native markdown editor

4.	**While using the Notebook** users can use the following features to increase **productivity**:
    •	Use Table of content
    •	Snippets
    •	Use Intellicode
    •	Use Cell Status Bar

    •	Export to Notebooks, PDF or Latex to share
    •	Git via Terminal
6.	When the **exploratory work in a notebook is finished**, users will be able to **open in VSCode** to finish up any extra development work.
